Civic Data Alliance of Louisville, Kentucky attempting to get a local copy of CityVoice running for CodeAcross 2016

View the upstream [README.md](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cityvoice#cityvoice---), which contains configuration and deployment information.

Louisville's status:

* We have recorded our 'hello world' phone polls to the Civic Data Alliance fork of CityVoice
* We have a "development" database runnable on our production server - puttin the HACK back in Hackthon - under user d\*\*\*\*\*e - from the right directory type "bin/rails server"
* Need production deployment (not WEBrick)
