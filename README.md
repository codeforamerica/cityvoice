=========
CityVoice is a place-based call-in system to collect community feedback on geographic entities (like vacant properties) using the simple, accessible medium of the telephone.

Using CityVoice in your city
---------------

CityVoice is an open source project, and we'd love for you to use it yourself!

To use CityVoice, there are three main steps:

- [Making a CityVoice survey](#making-a-cityvoice-survey)
- [Deploying the web application](#deploying-the-app)
- [Outreach and marketing to the community](#outreach-and-marketing)

Following this documentation, a semi-technical user — someone with experience using a terminal or command prompt — who has an idea of what kind of survey they would like to run should be able to get CityVoice up and running in a relatively short amount of time (less than a day).

Using the recommended deployment instructions below, the tech cost (hosting and other services) should run you about $50 per month.

If you have problems using CityVoice, please [open an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cityvoice/issues/new) and let us know what problems or difficulties you encountered in as much detail as you can.


Making a CityVoice survey
-----

What you'll need to make a CityVoice survey:

1. A set of locations (for example, properties or neighborhoods) that callers will call in about or from
2. A set of 2-5 questions that you want to ask callers
  - Agree/disagree questions
  - A voice message question
3. A microphone (for example, using a laptop or phone) to record mp3 audio files

The exact steps for making and setting these up in CityVoice are in [the "Making a Survey" document](making_a_survey.md).



Deploying the app
----------

### Third-Party Services

Before deploying, here are the third-party services that are either required or easiest to use.

#### 1. (Required) [Twilio](https://twilio.com) — telephone API

First, you'll need a paid Twilio account and phone number:

- [Register an account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and add payment information
- [Buy a phone number](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/available/local)

If you're new to Twilio, you'll have to add $10 in credit (the minimum) to your account to get started. This will be more than enough for CityVoice, which required $1/month for the phone number and 1 cent per call minute (~ $2/month in total).

#### 2. (Recommended) [Heroku](https://heroku.com) — application hosting

Heroku is an easy and cheap (~$50/month) way to host your CityVoice instance.

If you have experience with Ruby on Rails, you can alternately deploy to any infrastructure that supports a Rails 4 application and Postgres.


### Deploying on Heroku

To follow the below instructions, you will first need to [install the Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) on your computer.

Below are example instructions for deploying to Heroku. The process will be similar for other platforms (e.g., Amazon EC2, Red Hat OpenShift).

First, clone the application:

	$ git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/cityvoice.git

Go into the repo folder:

    $ cd cityvoice

Create a Heroku app:

    $ heroku create
    
Set the secret token:

    $ heroku config:set SECRET_TOKEN=`python -c 'import uuid; print uuid.uuid4()'`

Take the CSV and mp3 files content you created in the "[Making a CityVoice survey](making_a_survey.md)" section, put them in their destination folders (`/data` and `/app/assets/audios/`) and add and commit them into the repo.

	$ git add data/ app/assets/audios/
	$ git commit -m "Add customized CSVs and audio files for my deployment"

Next, push the code to Heroku:

    $ git push heroku master

Migrate the database:

    $ heroku run rake db:migrate

Load the locations and questions:

    $ heroku run rake import:locations
    $ heroku run rake import:questions

Add an additional web dyno so that the app never sleeps (this is necessary so the app always answers when people call in):

	$ heroku ps:scale web=2


#### Configuring Twilio

To configure your number on Twilio's site, log in and go to [your "Numbers" page](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming). Then click on the phone number you bought.

In the 'Voice' area, put your deployed application's URL followed by `/calls` in the 'Request URL' field and select `HTTP POST` from the dropdown.

For example, for an app at http://my-cityvoice-instance.herokuapp.com:

#### Optional features

CityVoice also has a number of optional features you can set up:

- [Email notifications](optional_features.md#email-notifications)
- [Custom map tiles](optional_features.md#custom-map-tiles)
- [Google Analytics](optional_features.md#google-analytics)
- [Password protection](optional_features.md#password-protection)


Outreach and Marketing
-----

Effective outreach might be the most important piece to making your use of CityVoice a success. Here are some tips from past CityVoice uses that might be helpful:

- Physical, prominent, and persistent calls to action are very useful. For example, a large sign in a park that's there for two months is much better than a poster on a bulletin board with 20 other posters or a mass email.

- Promotion, outreach, and media campaigns around the application are incredibly important. Without an effective campaign no one will know or care about the project.

- The application is really built to ask questions about locations. Although it can work in other situations, it works best when tied to specific places.

For developers - local setup
-----------

If you're a software developer and would like to work on CityVoice, this section will get you up and running.

CityVoice is a Ruby on Rails 4 application and uses Postgres as its database (other databases may work, but are untested).

To get started with development, clone the repo and cd into the directory:

	$ git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/cityvoice.git
	$ cd cityvoice

Use Bundler to install dependencies:

    $ bundle install

To get the application set up for local development, first copy database.yml:

    $ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

Then, edit it for your local Postgres installation and run:

    $ rake db:reset db:test:prepare

Next, load some sample data:

    $ rake import:locations
    $ rake import:questions

Tests are written in RSpec, and can be run as normal:

	$ rake spec


### Twilio Local Setup

In order to set up Twilio for local development, you'll need a way to connect Twilio to your local machine.  The easiest way for this to happen is to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

Then, run `ngrok 3000` to open a tunnel:

    $ ngrok 3000
    Tunnel Status                 online
    Version                       1.6/1.5
    Forwarding                    http://xxx.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:3000
    Forwarding                    https://xxx.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:3000
    Web Interface                 127.0.0.1:4040

Log into your Twilio application, open up your [phone number](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming) and change the Voice Request URL to the your ngrok address with `/calls` at the end. For example:

`https://xxx.ngrok.com/calls`

Also select `POST` from the dropdown next to the URL box.
